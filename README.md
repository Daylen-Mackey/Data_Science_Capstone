Obesity rates in the United States are continuously climbing. It's no secret that an unhealthy diet
and lack of exercise contribute to the problem, but there are still many unknowns.

Wallethub compared data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, County Health Rankings, United States Department of
Agriculture Economic Research Service, Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative,
Gallup-Sharecare, and Trust for America's Health, and ranked the 100 ‘Fattest’ cities in the
country.
## The Project:
Using the Foursquare API, I take a look at two cities on the opposite end of the list (Memphis and Portland) and compare the number of fast food restaurants, gyms, grocery stores, and discount stores for statistical significance.

## Check out "Data Science Capstone.ipynb" for the code, and "IBM Data Science Capstone Report.pdf" for the final findings.
