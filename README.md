# Data_Science_Capstone
For this week, you will required to submit the following:

1) A description of the problem and a discussion of the background:
Obesity rates in Canada are continuosly climbing. It's no secret that an unhealthy diet and lack of excercise contribute to the problem, but there are still many unknowns.
I would like to see if there is a measurable correlation between the number percentage of obese adults in major Canadian cities, and the number of gyms and fast food chains in those resepctive cities.

2) A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem:
- To collect the number of gyms and fast food restaurants in a given city, I will use the foursquare API from the last assignment.
- To collect the data on obesity, I will be using the following website: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310079401
- Since obesity is organized by province, I will be using gym and restaurant data from that capital city, and seeing how it relates to the province as a whole.
- Multiple Regression models will be used
